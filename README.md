* Make rspec tests that work for each method in the practice_rspec.rb file
  - practice setting context/describe specific state with let
  - feel free to change content of given methods to practice with different rspec matchers
  - unimplemented test cases have comments labeling the method they should refer to in their expectations
    - also, there may be comments indicating additional required knowledge, or a start off point for your research if you want to attempt the given challenge
